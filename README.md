Howdy!

###WotDeFOSS is this?

This is a test page i made to dip my feet in MixItUp.js, which is a sorting/filtering jQuery Plugin made by KunkaLabs.

### What does this package include?

Just a few source files and an index.html, containing  MixItUp in action

## Can I use this for myself?

Ofcourse! I made this for educational purposes only, but if you feel like you could use this too, go for it! Just clone/fork this repo and you're good to go! :D

#NOTE 

If you're gonna use MixItUp commercially, you're going to have to buy a commercial licence.
